1. To emphasize a word, surround it with asterisks, like so: *emphasized*. Things will detect this and render the word in italics. If you remove the asterisks, it goes back to normal again.
2. # A header usually starts with a hash "#"
3. Headers have 6 levels from most important to least. 6 hashtags would represent the least most important and of course one hash is most important.
4. Use one asterisks " * "  for italics *ialic*
5. Use two asterisks " ** " for **bold**
6. Use two colons " :: " for ::highlight::
