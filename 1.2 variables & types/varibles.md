# Variables
`input` asks for something, takes it, but then has nowhere to put it. We can change that with a `variable` which is a value that we can use to name and store data. <br>
_A variable can have any name desired, but cannot contain spaces. Underscores between words are optional._

```python
myName = input("What's you name?: ") # bria
myAge = input("How old are you? :") # 23
print("Gee, that's REALLY YOUNG")
python = input("Do you like python?")
print("OF COURSE YOU DO!")
```

# Printing a variable
You can print your variable using `print` and the name you used for your variable in your `input` command.
```python
print()
print("So, you are")
print(myName)
print("and are the ripe old age of")
print(myAge)
print("and clearly think that python is")
print(python)
```
