## If, Elif, Else 
__You can use if, elif (short for “else if”), and else to perform different actions based on certain conditions.. if condition is not met with the if statement, then we want the computer to do the else part instead. Likewise, if the condition is met in the if statement, then the else


**Here’s simple examples:**
````python
myName = input("What's your name?: ") 
if myName == "David":
  print("Welcome Dude!")

age = 18
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age < 60:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
````
